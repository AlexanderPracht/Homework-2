# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather <- weather %>%
  select(c(Year,Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec))%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, names_to = "Month", values_to = "delta")

```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y=delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~month)+
  labs (
    title= "The effect of increasing temperature pronounced in all months"
    ,subtitle = "Weather Anomalies for each month"
  )
```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Delta becoing more positive over the decades",
    subtitle = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title="Average yearly anomaly increasing exponentially since the 1960s",
    subtitle = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  filter(interval == "2011-present")%>%
  summarise(mean_diff=mean(delta,na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_diff=sd(delta, na.rm = TRUE), 
            count_diff=n(), 
            se_diff=sd_diff/sqrt(count_diff), 
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count_diff-1),
            lower = mean_diff-t_critical*se_diff,
            upper = mean_diff+t_critical*se_diff)

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 

#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta

library(infer)
set.seed(1234)
data_infer <- comparison %>%
   filter(interval == "2011-present")%>%
  specify(response = delta)%>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type="bootstrap")%>%
  calculate(stat="mean")

percentile_ci <- data_infer %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level=0.95, type="percentile")

percentile_ci
```

> What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!

The data shows us (for both methods, with the formula as well as with the infer package) that we can be 95% sure that the real mean of the population of temperature differences lies between 0.917 and 1.02.

# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
glimpse(gss)
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram
```{r}
social_media <- gss%>%
  mutate(snap_insta = if_else(snapchat == "NA" & instagrm == "NA", "NA", if_else(snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm == "Yes", "Yes", "No")))

glimpse(social_media)

social_media_stats <- social_media %>%
  group_by(snap_insta)%>%
  count(snap_insta)%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=snap_insta, values_from = n )%>%
  mutate(proportion_yes = Yes/(Yes+No))

social_media_summary <- social_media %>% 
  filter(snap_insta != "NA") %>% 
  mutate(snap_insta_num = snap_insta == "Yes") %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(),
            mean_prob = mean(snap_insta_num),
            sd_prob = sd(snap_insta_num),
            t_critical_95 = qt(0.975, count-1),
            lower_bound = mean_prob - t_critical_95 * (sd_prob/(count)^0.5),
            upper_bound = mean_prob + t_critical_95 * (sd_prob/(count)^0.5)
            )

social_media_summary
```

```{r}
ggplot(social_media_summary, 
       aes(sex, mean_prob, ymin = lower_bound, ymax = upper_bound))+
  geom_errorbar(width = 0.2, size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  theme_bw() +
  #xlim(0.2, 0.8) +
  #labs(x=NULL, y= "Sample mean and 95% CIs") +
  labs(title = "CIs for males/females who use Snapchat or Instagram do not overlap",
       subtitle = "Proportion of people using either Snapchat or Instagram by gender",
       x="Sex (Males/Female)", y= "Proportion of people using Snapchat or Instagram") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = 3, ymin = social_media_summary$upper_bound[2], ymax=social_media_summary$lower_bound[1]), fill = "red", alpha = 0.2, size=0.1) +
  NULL
```
We observe that these two intervals do not overlap.


## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascneding order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. *Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does*. 
1. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. *As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.*
1. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?

```{r}
degree_factor <- c("Lt high school", "High School", "Junior college", "Bachelor", "Graduate")
degree <- as.factor(degree_factor)
twitter_education <- social_media %>%
  mutate(bachelor_graduate= case_when(degree %in% c("Bachelor", "Graduate")~"Yes",
                                      TRUE ~ "No"))%>%
  filter(bachelor_graduate=="Yes")%>%
  group_by(twitter)%>%
  count(twitter)%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = twitter, values_from = n)%>%
  mutate(proportion_yes = Yes/(Yes+No),
         se=sqrt(proportion_yes*(1-proportion_yes)/(Yes+No)),
         t_critical = qt(0.975, (Yes+No)-1),
         lower_yes = proportion_yes - t_critical*se,
         upper_yes = proportion_yes + t_critical*se,
         lower_no = (1-proportion_yes) - t_critical*se,
         upper_no = (1-proportion_yes) + t_critical*se)

```


No the 2 intervals do not overlap.


## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
1. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amoung of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?
1. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.
1. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.

```{r}
email_data <- social_media%>%
  mutate(email = ifelse(emailmin=="NA", "NA", as.double(emailhr)*60 + as.double(emailmin)))
```

# Trump's Approval Margins

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'approval_polllist.csv'))

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot
Trump's net approval rate each week faceted by year.

```{r Trump_approval_margin}
approval_polllist <- approval_polllist %>% 
  mutate(net_approval = approve - disapprove,
         date = mdy(enddate),
         year = year(date),
         week = week(date))

Trump_approval_margin <- approval_polllist %>% 
  group_by(year, week) %>% 
  summarise(mean_net_approval = mean(net_approval),
            sd_net_approval = sd(net_approval),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_net_approval = sd_net_approval/sqrt(count),
            low_net_approval = mean_net_approval - t_critical*se_net_approval,
            high_net_approval = mean_net_approval + t_critical*se_net_approval)

```

```{r picture_Trump_approval_margin, fig.height=10, fig.width=20}
p <- Trump_approval_margin %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = mean_net_approval, color = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = low_net_approval, ymax = high_net_approval, fill = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#FF0000", "#32CD32", "#236B81", "#9932CD", "organge")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c("#FF0000", "#32CD32", "#236B81", "#9932CD"), 0.1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 13, 26, 39, 52)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-20, 7.5, by = 2.5)) +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1/1.5) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=0), color = "orange") +
  labs(title = "Estimating Net Approval (approve-disapprove) for Donald Trump", 
       subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls",
       x = "Week of the year",
       y = "Average Net Approval (%)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme_bw()

p
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals for week 15 and week 20 in 2020

```{r}
Trump_approval_margin %>% 
  filter(week %in% c(15, 34), year == 2020) %>% 
  select(c(year, week, low_net_approval, high_net_approval))

```

Trump's net approval rate decreased greatly from 2020 week 15 to week 34, with larger interval. I think the reason of lower net approval rate is that most people were disappointed with Trump's inability to contain coronavirus. What's more, the greater deviation in net approval rate caused a higher standard error and therefore a larger confidence interval for week 34.


# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- read_csv(here::here("session4-workshop2/data","worldbank_data.csv")) %>% 
  select(country,date,SP.DYN.TFRT.IN,SE.PRM.NENR, SH.DYN.MORT, NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
        
                         

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

I use left join, because left join enables to preserve the original observations even when there isn' a match. The worldbank_data has the most entries, so left join life_expectancy and then hiv data to it.
```{r}
life_expectancy_1 <- life_expectancy %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:302, 
               names_to="date", 
               values_to = "life_expectancy") %>% 
  filter(date>=1960& date<=2016) %>% 
  mutate(date=as.numeric(date))

hiv_1<-hiv %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:34, 
               names_to="date", 
               values_to = "hiv_prevalence") %>% 
  mutate(date=as.numeric(date))

country_1<- countries %>% 
  select(country,region)

join<- left_join(worldbank_data,country_1)
join<- left_join(join,life_expectancy_1)
join<- left_join(join,hiv_1)
```

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful

For most regions, including East Asia & Pacific, Lattin America & Carribean, Middle East & North Africa, Sub-Seharan Africa, there exists a negative relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy.
In North America and South Asia, the relaionship is not obvious, since the linear regression lines are nearly flat.
In Europe & Central Asia, the relationship becomes slightly positive, which means a higher HIV prevalence with higher life expectancy.
```{r}
ggplot(join,aes(x=hiv_prevalence, y = life_expectancy))+
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~region,scales = "free_x") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,50,100),limits=c(0,100)) +
  labs(title = "Relationship between HIV prevalence and Life expectancy", 
       x = "HIV prevalence",
       y = "Life expectancy") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme_bw()
```

1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful

For all regions, the relationships between fertility rate and GDP per capota are negative: the higher the fertility rate, the lower the GDP per capita. However, there are some exceptional countries in each region.
```{r}
ggplot(join,aes(x=SP.DYN.TFRT.IN, y = NY.GDP.PCAP.KD))+
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~region,scales = "free_y") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +

1. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.

Europe & Central Asia has the most observations with missing HIV data.
```{r}
missing_HIV<-join %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  summarise(hiv_NA=sum(is.na(hiv_prevalence))) %>% 
  arrange(desc(hiv_NA))
ggplot(missing_HIV,aes(y=hiv_NA,x=reorder(region,-hiv_NA)))+
  geom_col()+
  theme_economist() +
  labs(title="Missing HIV Data in Different Regions", y="Missing HIV Data", x="Region") 
  
```

1. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.
```{r}

  select(country,date,SH.DYN.MORT,region) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  mutate(change_mortality=SH.DYN.MORT[which(date==2016)]-SH.DYN.MORT[which(date==1960)]) %>% 
  select(country,region,change_mortality) %>% 
  filter (! duplicated(country))
Top5_mort_improvement<-mortality %>%

Top5_mort_improvement
Least5_mort_improvement<-mortality %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  arrange (-change_mortality) %>%

1. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?

Yes, there is a negative relationship between primary school enrollment rate and fertility rate. The higher the fertility rate is, the lower the primary school enrollment rate. 
However, the relationship is not obvious in Europe & Central Asia, and North America, probably becasue the familities in these two regions are wealthy enough to afford children's education, even with more children.

# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). 

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()
```

We will replicate the two graphs as follows.

```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)
```

## Covid death % by age group, sex and whether the patient had co-morbidities

First we need to select data of interest - sex, age group, whether the patient had co-morbidities and whether the patient died, and clean missing and unknown values.

```{r interest_data, echo=TRUE}
covid_death <-covid_data %>% 
  #select column of interest
  select(sex, age_group, medcond_yn, death_yn) %>% 
  #Remove missing and unknown values
  filter(sex %in% c("Male", "Female"), 
         age_group %in% c("0 - 9 Years", "10 - 19 Years", "20 - 29 Years", "30 - 39 Years", "40 - 49 Years", "50 - 59 Years","60 - 69 Years", "70 - 79 Years", "80+ Years"),
         medcond_yn %in% c("Yes", "No"),
         death_yn %in% c("Yes", "No"))
  
```

We will calculate the covid death rate here.

```{r death_rate_medcond}
covid_death_rate_medcond <- covid_death %>% 
  #group by age group, sex and whether the patient had co-morbidities
  group_by(age_group, sex, medcond_yn) %>% 
  #calculate death rate
  summarise (yes = sum(death_yn == "Yes"),
             no = sum(death_yn == "No"),
             death_rate = (yes/sum(yes+no))*100)
 
```

```{r replace_name, echo=TRUE}
# Turn `medcond_yn` from character to a factor variable and replace the names
covid_death_rate_medcond <- covid_death_rate_medcond %>% 
  mutate(medcond_yn = factor(medcond_yn, 
                       levels = c("Yes", "No"),
                       labels = c("With comorbidities", "Without comorbidities")))
covid_death_rate_medcond
```
Finally we produce the plot showing the death rate by age group, sex and whether the patient had comorbidities.

```{r covid_death_rate_medcond, echo=TRUE}
# Plot object
ggplot(covid_death_rate_medcond, aes(x = age_group,y = death_rate)) +
  # Add columns (pre-counted)
  geom_col(fill = "#1D1FAB", show.legend=FALSE, alpha=0.7, width =0.7) +  # Add a bit of trans[arecy and reduce width
  # Add labels to columns
  geom_text(aes(label=round(death_rate, digits = 1)), #round the data label to one decimal
            hjust=0.08,
            size=2) +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_grid(medcond_yn ~ sex, scales="free") + #facet by whether the patient had comorbidities and sex presence
  # Flip horizontal
  coord_flip() +
  # Add labels
  labs (title = "Covid death % by age group, sex and presence of co-morbidities",
        xlab = "",
        ylab = "",
        caption = "Source: CDC") +
  # Remove extras
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), #remove unnecessary x and y axis title
        axis.title.y = element_blank())

```
## Covid death % by age group, sex and whether the patient was admitted to ICU

First we need to select data of interest - sex, age group, whether the patient was admitted to ICU and whether the patient died, and remove missing and unknown values.

```{r interest_2, echo=TRUE}
covid_death <-covid_data %>% 
  #select column of interest
  select(sex, age_group, icu_yn, death_yn) %>% 
  #Remove missing and unknown values
  filter(sex %in% c("Male", "Female"), 
         age_group %in% c("0 - 9 Years", "10 - 19 Years", "20 - 29 Years", "30 - 39 Years", "40 - 49 Years", "50 - 59 Years","60 - 69 Years", "70 - 79 Years", "80+ Years"),
         icu_yn %in% c("Yes", "No"),
         death_yn %in% c("Yes", "No"))
  
```

We will calculate the death rate here. 

```{r death_rate_icu, echo=TRUE}
covid_death_rate_icu <- covid_death %>%
  #group by age group, sex and whether the patient was admitted to ICU
  group_by(age_group, sex, icu_yn) %>%
  #calculate death rate
  summarise (yes = sum(death_yn == "Yes"),
             no = sum(death_yn == "No"),
             death_rate = (yes/sum(yes+no))*100)
```

```{r replace_name_2, echo=TRUE}
# Turn `icu_yn` from character to a factor variable
covid_death_rate_icu <- covid_death_rate_icu %>% 
  mutate(icu_yn = factor(icu_yn, 
                       levels = c("Yes", "No"),
                       labels = c("Admitted to ICU", "No ICU")))
```

Finally we produce the plot showing the death rate by age group, sex and whether the patient was admitted to ICU.

```{r covid_death_rate_icu, echo=TRUE}
# plot object

ggplot(covid_death_rate_icu, aes(x=age_group, y=death_rate)) +
  # Add columns (pre-counted)
  geom_col(fill = "#fcae91", show.legend=FALSE, alpha=0.9, width=0.7) + # add a bit of transparecy and reduce width
  # Add theme
  theme_bw() +
  # Add text
  geom_text(aes(label=round(death_rate, digits = 1)),
            hjust=0.08,
            size=2) +
  facet_grid(icu_yn ~ sex, scales="free") +
  # Flip horizontal
  coord_flip() +
  # Add lables
  labs (title = "Covid death % by age group, sex and whether the patient was admitted to ICU",
        xlab = "",
        ylab = "",
        caption = "Source: CDC") +
  # Remove extras
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank())


# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r tfl_calc, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

bike1 <- bike %>% 
  group_by(year,month) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  summarise(actual_rentals = sum(bikes_hired, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  mutate(expected_rentals = mean(actual_rentals, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, 1))

ggplot(bike1, aes(x=month, y=actual_rentals))+
  geom_smooth()+
  #geom_smooth(color="red") +
  #theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  labs (
    title= ""
    ,subtitle = ""
  )

```
For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
