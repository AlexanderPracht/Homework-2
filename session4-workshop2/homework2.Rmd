# 1. Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Firstly, we need to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}
weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")
```

Then we select the year and the months from the ‘weather’ dataset and convert it to a long format.

```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather <- weather %>%
  select(c(Year,Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec))%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, names_to = "Month", values_to = "Delta")
glimpse(tidyweather)
```
We observe that the dataframe has 3 variables: Year, Month, and Delta (Temparature Deviation)

## 1.a Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 

```{r scatter_plot}
tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = Delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )
```

We create a scatter plot for each month.

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y=Delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~month)+
  labs (
    title= "The effect of increasing temperature is observed in all months"
    ,subtitle = "Weather Anomalies for each month"
  )
```

Looking at the plot we created, we observe that delta is increasing over time for all months. However, it seems that this increase is more pronounced in Winter. For instance, in October - March, the delta is closer to 1.5, whereas in the summer months it is around 1.

We would like to group the data into different time periods to study the large historical data. The most convenient way to do this is to refer to decades such as 1980s, 1990s etc. NASA calculates the temperature anomalies, as differed from the base period of 1951-1980. Thus, we create a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in 5 time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present.

We remove the data before 1800 and use `mutate` function to create a new variable `intervals` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We used `case_when()` to assign different periods.

```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>% 
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) + 
  theme_bw() +          
  labs (
    title = "Delta gets more positive over the decades",
    subtitle = "Density Plot for Monthly Deltas (Temparature Anomalies)",
    y     = "Density"   
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

avg_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  summarise(annual_avg_delta = mean(Delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

ggplot(avg_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_avg_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title="Average yearly anomaly has been increasing exponentially since the 1960s",
    subtitle = "Average Yearly Temparature Anomaly (Delta)",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         

```


## 1.2 Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Now, we construct a 95% confidence interval for our data.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

calculate_ci <- comparison %>% 
  filter(interval == "2011-present")%>%
  summarise(mean_diff=mean(delta,na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_diff=sd(delta, na.rm = TRUE), 
            count_diff=n(), 
            se_diff=sd_diff/sqrt(count_diff), 
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count_diff-1),
            lower = mean_diff-t_critical*se_diff,
            upper = mean_diff+t_critical*se_diff)

#print out formula_CI
calculate_ci
```

The 95% confidence interval for delta is 0.916-1.02.

Now, we use the bootstrap method to create a confidence interval.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta

library(infer)
set.seed(1234)
data_infer <- comparison %>%
   filter(interval == "2011-present")%>%
  specify(response = delta)%>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type="bootstrap")%>%
  calculate(stat="mean")

percentile_ci <- data_infer %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level=0.95, type="percentile")

percentile_ci
```

We have created two confidence intervals using two methods, one using our dataset and the other via bootstrapping for mean delta. The bootstrap method generates 1000 samples with replacement and approximates the distribution to estimate sample variability. The data shows us (for both methods, with the formula as well as with the infer package) that we can be 95% sure that the real mean of the population of temperature differences lies between 0.917 and 1.02. 

# 2. General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
glimpse(gss)
```

We observe that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like “No Answer”, “Don’t Know”, “Not applicable”, “Refused to Answer”, thus, we merge them under `na`.

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained

## 2.1. Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

We estimate the population proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016.

Firstly, we create a new variable, snap_insta that is Yes if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (snapchat) or Instagram (instagrm), and No if not.


```{r}

social_media <- gss%>%
  mutate(snap_insta = if_else(snapchat == "NA" & instagrm == "NA", "NA", if_else(snapchat == "Yes" | instagrm == "Yes", "Yes", "No")))

glimpse(social_media)

```

We calculate the proportion of Yes’s for snap_insta among those who answered the question and add it to a new column.

```{r}

social_media_stats <- social_media %>%
  group_by(snap_insta)%>%
  count(snap_insta)%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=snap_insta, values_from = n )%>%
  mutate(proportion_yes = Yes/(Yes+No))

social_media_stats

```

We observe that the proportion of people being active on either Snapchat or Instagram is 37.5%.

Using the formula for finding the Confidence Interval, we construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram.


```{r}

social_media_summary <- social_media %>% 
  filter(snap_insta != "NA") %>% 
  mutate(snap_insta_num = snap_insta == "Yes") %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(),
            mean_prob = mean(snap_insta_num),
            sd_prob = sd(snap_insta_num),
            t_critical_95 = qt(0.975, count-1),
            lower_bound = mean_prob - t_critical_95 * (sd_prob/(count)^0.5),
            upper_bound = mean_prob + t_critical_95 * (sd_prob/(count)^0.5)
            )

social_media_summary

```

The confidence intervals for males and females are shown in the table above.

```{r}
ggplot(social_media_summary, 
       aes(sex, mean_prob, ymin = lower_bound, ymax = upper_bound))+
  geom_errorbar(width = 0.2, size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Confidence Intervals for males and females who use Snapchat or Instagram do not overlap",
       subtitle = "Confidence Intervals of Proportion of people using either Snapchat or Instagram by gender",
       x="Sex (Male/Female)", y= "Proportion of people using Snapchat or Instagram") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = 3, ymin = social_media_summary$upper_bound[2], ymax=social_media_summary$lower_bound[1]), fill = "red", alpha = 0.1, size=0.1) +
  NULL
```

Finally, when we plot the output, we can see that the confidence intervals for females and males do not overlap considering their CIs for Snapchat or Instagram use proportions.


## 2.2. Twitter, by education level

We estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016.

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascneding order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

First, we turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable.
Second, we create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree.

```{r}
twitter_population <- gss %>% 
  mutate(degree = factor(degree, order = TRUE, levels = c("Lt high school", "High school", "Junior college", "Bachelor", "Graduate")),
         bachelor_graduate = if_else(degree >= "Bachelor", "Yes", "No"))

twitter_population

```

We calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 

```{r}
twitter_bach <- twitter_population %>% 
  filter(bachelor_graduate == "Yes", twitter != "NA") %>% 
  mutate(twitter_num = twitter == "Yes") %>% 
  group_by(bachelor_graduate, twitter) %>% 
  count()

twitter_bach
```

We use the CI formula for proportions to construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 

```{r}
twitter_bach <- twitter_population %>% 
  filter(bachelor_graduate != "NA", twitter != "NA") %>% 
  mutate(twitter_num = twitter == "Yes") %>% 
  group_by(bachelor_graduate, twitter) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = twitter, values_from = n) %>% 
  mutate(proportion_twitter_users = Yes /(Yes+No),
         proportion_notwitter_users = No /(Yes+No))

twitter_bach
```
```{r}
graduate_ci <- twitter_pop %>% 
  filter(twitter != "NA", bachelor_graduate != "NA") %>% 
  mutate(bachelor_graduate_adj = bachelor_graduate == "Yes") %>% 
  group_by(twitter) %>% 
  summarize(count = n(),
            proportion_graduate = mean(bachelor_graduate_adj),
            sd_prop = sd(bachelor_graduate_adj),
            t_critical_95 = qt(0.975, count-1),
            lower_bound_95 = proportion_graduate - t_critical_95 * (sd_prop/(count)^0.5),
            upper_bound_95 = proportion_graduate + t_critical_95 * (sd_prop/(count)^0.5)
            )


graduate_ci%>%
  
  select(lower_bound_95,upper_bound_95)
```
```{r}
ggplot(graduate_ci, 
       aes(twitter, proportion_graduate, ymax = upper_bound_95, ymin = lower_bound_95))+
  geom_errorbar(aes(width = 0.2), size = 1) + #other way would be errorbar
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  theme_bw() +
  #xlim(0.2, 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Confidence intervals for 'bachelor_graduate' proportions do not overlap",
       subtitle = "CI for proportion of twitter users that are either graduate or bachelor",
       x="Twitter user: (Yes/No)", y= "Proportion of bachelors and graduates") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = 3, ymin = graduate_ci$upper_bound_95[1], ymax=graduate_ci$lower_bound_95[2]), fill = "red", alpha = 0.1, size=0.1) +
  NULL
```

We observe that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. This shows that there is a significant difference between in education between twitter users and non-twitter users.

## Email usage

We estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly.

We create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly, and then summarise it.

```{r}

email_pop <- gss %>% 
  mutate(email_in_min = as.numeric(hours(emailhr) + minutes(emailmin),"minutes"))

email_pop %>% filter(!is.na(email_in_min)) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(email_in_min), median = median(email_in_min))

```

We visualise the distribution of this new variable.

```{r}
email_pop %>% 
  filter(!is.na(email_in_min)) %>% 
  summarize(count = n(),
            mean_email_time = mean(email_in_min, na.rm = TRUE),
            median_email_time = median(email_in_min, na.rm = TRUE))
```
We create a density plot to visualise it.

```{r}

ggplot(email_pop, aes(x = email_in_min))+
  geom_density(fill = "grey") +
  theme_bw()+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(email_pop$email_in_min, na.rm = TRUE), color="mean"), size = 1, linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(email_pop$email_in_min, na.rm = TRUE), color="median"), size = 1, linetype = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "statistics", values = c(mean = "blue", median = "red")) +
  labs(title = "Density of the answers and few outliers make the disrtibution heavily right-skewed",
       subtitle = "Density plot for amount of minutes respondents spent on email",
       x = "Time spent on emails (min)",
       y = "Density") + 
  geom_text(mapping = aes(x = mean(email_pop$email_in_min, na.rm = TRUE),
                          y = 0,
                          label = round(mean(email_pop$email_in_min, na.rm = TRUE),0), 
                          hjust = 0, vjust = -0.5, angle=90),colour="blue") +
  geom_text(mapping = aes(x = median(email_pop$email_in_min, na.rm = TRUE),
                          y = 0,
                          label = round(median(email_pop$email_in_min, na.rm = TRUE),0), 
                          hjust = 0, vjust = -0.5, angle=90),colour="red") +
  
  #scale_x_log10() +
  NULL
```
We see that the median is a better choice in this situation while the distribution is skewed. The median is more robust against outliers than the mean.

We use bootstrapping method to find the 95% confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly.

```{r}
library(infer)

set.seed(1234)

point_estimate = mean(email_pop$email_in_min, na.rm = TRUE)

email_pop_ci <- email_pop %>% 
  specify(formula = email_in_min ~ NULL) %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean") %>% 
  get_ci(type = "se", point_estimate = point_estimate) %>% 
  mutate(point_estimate = point_estimate)
  

email_pop_ci %>% 
  mutate(lower_ci = hms::as.hms(lower_ci),
         upper_ci = hms::as.hms(upper_ci),
         point_estimate = hms::as.hms(point_estimate)
         )
```

We conclude that the 95% confidence interval goes from 6 hours and 23 minutes up to 7 hours and 30 minutes. This means that we can be 95% percent sure that our interval includes the true population mean.

For instance, if we were to increase our confidence to 99%, we can expect wider confidence interval. If the range of our interval increases, we are more likely to capture the true population mean within our interval.

## Compare Confidence Intervals for week 15 and week 20 in 2020
>>>>>>> c328db46431fb29c4ccd87fe9303a735a867bb2c

```{r}
Trump_approval_margin %>% 
  filter(week %in% c(15, 34), year == 2020) %>% 
  select(c(year, week, low_net_approval, high_net_approval))

```

Trump's net approval rate decreased greatly from 2020 week 15 to week 34, with larger interval. I think the reason of lower net approval rate is that most people were disappointed with Trump's inability to contain coronavirus. What's more, the greater deviation in net approval rate caused a higher standard error and therefore a larger confidence interval for week 34.


# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- read_csv(here::here("data","worldbank_data.csv")) %>%

```

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

I use left join, because left join enables to preserve the original observations even when there isn' a match. The worldbank_data has the most entries, so left join life_expectancy and then hiv data to it.
```{r}
hiv_tidy <- hiv %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=c('1979':'2011'),names_to = "date",values_to = "hiv_percentage")
hiv_tidy$date <- as.numeric(hiv_tidy$date)

life_expectancy_tidy <- life_expectancy %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=c('1800':'2100'),names_to = "date",values_to = "life_exp")
life_expectancy_tidy$date <- as.numeric(life_expectancy_tidy$date)  

  
region_worldbank_data <- left_join(countries, worldbank_data, by = "country") %>%
  filter(region != "Aggregates")

countries_data <- full_join(region_worldbank_data, life_expectancy_tidy, by = c("country", "date"))

countries_data <- full_join(countries_data, hiv_tidy, by = c("country", "date")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(region))
```

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful

For most regions, including East Asia & Pacific, Lattin America & Carribean, Middle East & North Africa, Sub-Seharan Africa, there exists a negative relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy.
In North America and South Asia, the relaionship is not obvious, since the linear regression lines are nearly flat.
In Europe & Central Asia, the relationship becomes slightly positive, which means a higher HIV prevalence with higher life expectancy.
```{r}
countries_hiv_lifeexp <- countries_data %>%
  filter(date >= 1960, #very few datapoint before 1990
         date <= 2011) %>% #No datapoint for hiv prevalence after 2011
  group_by(country, region) %>%
  summarise(mean_hiv = mean(hiv_percentage, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_life_exp = mean(life_exp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  na.omit()

  ggplot(countries_hiv_lifeexp, aes(x = mean_hiv, y = mean_life_exp))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  facet_wrap(~region,scales="free")+ #faceting by countries will make too many plots and it can't show the whole trend
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x = "HIV Prevalence", 
       y = "Life Expectancy", 
       title = "Relationship between HIV Prevalence and Life Expectancy",
       subtitle = "Between 1960 and 2011")
```

1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful

For all regions, the relationships between fertility rate and GDP per capota are negative: the higher the fertility rate, the lower the GDP per capita. However, there are some exceptional countries in each region.
```{r}
ggplot(countries_data, aes(x = NY.GDP.PCAP.KD, y = SP.DYN.TFRT.IN))+
  geom_point(size = 0.9)+
  geom_smooth()+
  facet_wrap(~region,scale="free")+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x = "GDP per Capita", 
       y = "Fertility Rate", 
       title = "Relationship between Fertility Rate and GDP per Capita")
```

1. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.

Europe & Central Asia has the most observations with missing HIV data.
```{r}
countries_region_na <- countries_data %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(missing_hiv = sum(!is.na(hiv_percentage)))

ggplot(countries_region_na, aes(x = missing_hiv, y = reorder(region, missing_hiv)))+
  geom_col()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x = "Region",
       y = "Number of Missing HIV Data",
       title = "Number of Missing HIV Data across Different Regions")
  
```

1. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.

  summarise(mean_mortality = mean(SH.DYN.MORT, na.rm = TRUE)) #drop NA to find mean, otherwise returns NA

ggplot(countries_region_mortality, aes(x=date,y = mean_mortality ))+

1. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?

Yes, there is a negative relationship between primary school enrollment rate and fertility rate. The higher the fertility rate is, the lower the primary school enrollment rate. 
However, the relationship is not obvious in Europe & Central Asia, and North America, probably becasue the familities in these two regions are wealthy enough to afford children's education, even with more children.
```{r}
ggplot(countries_data, aes(x = SP.DYN.TFRT.IN, y = SE.PRM.NENR))+
  geom_point(size = 0.9)+
  geom_smooth()+
  facet_wrap(~region)+

# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). 

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()
library(scales)

```

We will replicate the two graphs as follows.

```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)
```

## Covid death % by age group, sex and whether the patient had co-morbidities

First we need to select data of interest - sex, age group, whether the patient had co-morbidities and whether the patient died, and clean missing and unknown values.

```{r interest_data, echo=TRUE}
covid_death_rate_comorbidities<-covid_data %>% 
  filter(sex %in% c('Male','Female'),!age_group %in% c('Unknown',NA),medcond_yn %in% c('Yes','No'),death_yn %in% c('Yes','No')) %>% #filter for relevant values
  select(sex,age_group,death_yn,medcond_yn) %>% 
  group_by(sex,age_group,medcond_yn) %>% 
  summarize(death=sum(death_yn=="Yes"),total=n()) %>% 
  mutate(death_rate=(death/total*100)) %>% 
  select(sex,age_group,medcond_yn,death_rate)

new_labels<-c('Yes'='With Comorbidities','No'='Without Comorbidities')

ggplot(covid_death_rate_comorbidities,aes(x=death_rate,y=age_group))+
geom_col(fill='navy')+
facet_grid(medcond_yn~sex,as.table=FALSE,labeller=labeller(medcond_yn=new_labels))+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(death_rate,digits=1)),hjust=-0.1,size=3)+
  expand_limits(x=c(0,72))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=label_percent(scale=1))+
  labs(title='Covid death % percent by age group, sex, and presence of co-morbidities',x='',y='',caption='Source:CDC')+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=9))
  

```

We will calculate the covid death rate here.
Finally we produce the plot showing the death rate by age group, sex and whether the patient had comorbidities.

```{r covid_death_rate_medcond, echo=TRUE}
covid_death_rate_icu<-covid_data %>% 
  filter(sex %in% c('Male','Female'),!age_group %in% c('Unknown',NA),icu_yn %in% c('Yes','No'),death_yn %in% c('Yes','No')) %>% 
  select(sex,age_group,death_yn,icu_yn) %>% 
  group_by(sex,age_group,icu_yn) %>% 
  summarize(death=sum(death_yn=="Yes"),total=n()) %>% 
  mutate(death_rate=(death/total*100)) %>% 
  select(sex,age_group,icu_yn,death_rate)

new_labels_icu<-c('Yes'='Admitted to ICU','No'='No ICU')

ggplot(covid_death_rate_icu,aes(x=death_rate,y=age_group))+
geom_col(fill='#ffa084')+
facet_grid(icu_yn~sex,as.table=FALSE,labeller=labeller(icu_yn=new_labels_icu))+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_text(aes(label=round(death_rate,digits=1)),hjust=-0.1,size=3)+
  expand_limits(x=c(0,85))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=label_percent(scale=1))+
  labs(title='Covid death % percent by age group, sex, and weather patient was admitted to ICU',x='',y='',caption='Source:CDC')+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=9)) 

```
# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE, locale= "English"),
          week = isoweek(day))
```


We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r tfl_calc, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width=10, fig.height=7}

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2015-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?
